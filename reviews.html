            "Had the most gorgeous Back, Neck & Shoulder massage today with Katie, first time using her, she‚Äôs so welcoming and makes you feel at ease and comfortable.She lets you relax but also makes sure that you are comfortable. She started out gently but was firm (had a lot of knots), it was perfect. 
            <span class="dots">...</span>
            <span class="more-text">The warming blanket underneath was lovely & cosy. Also had a facial, which she used amazing products that smelt great!! The steam & ice were lush!!! Would highly recommend Katie again and again. It was an overall amazing experience and I am already looking forward to my next treatment. Can't wait to go back! xxx</span>

            "Wowww what an hour of bliss üëè I have been fortunate enough to go to many spas in the UK and across Europe. However, none of them were as good as the back, shoulder and Indian head massage I got from Katie! 
            <span class="dots">...</span>
            <span class="more-text">Even the environment was perfect. There is nothing I could fault. 
Have already booked back in for another one and she now has a client for life! 
If you have a stressful job, busy day to day life or just fancy a bit of self care - I couldn‚Äôt recommend Katie enough. 
Don‚Äôt walk, Run to Sweet Serenity by Katie.  Would highly recommend Katie again and again. It was an overall amazing experience and I am already looking forward to my next treatment. Can't wait to go back! xxx"</span>
